Each constituent CNA metric (CNA-DOS-M1, CNA-BTC-M1, CNA-ILP-M1, CNA-MSE-M1, CNA-NCE-M1, CNA-CSC-M1, CNA-HAR-M1) must first yield a single normalized score from 0-100.

Review the IAM execution role associated with each function. Analyze permissions to ensure they are narrowly scoped to only the resources and actions required by the function. Use tools to identify overly permissive roles. Relate to SC-39 by ensuring each function invocation operates in a restricted, isolated execution environment defined by these minimal privileges.\nSLO Recommendation: 95% adherence, with a plan for 100%.",
