A minor deviation in the continuous scanning coverage for non-critical development assets (CNA-CSC-M1) was identified, and a satisfactory remediation plan is in progress by the Cloud Service Provider. All other assessed CNA metrics met or surpassed their defined Service Level Objectives. The LZA framework appears to provide a solid foundation for meeting these security objectives.
